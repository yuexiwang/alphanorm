Description: An implementation of alpha-norm regulariztaion linear model in R.
    The alpha-norm penalty has the property of jumping to a sparse solution. 
    This flexible nonconvex regularization problem is solved via cyclic
    coordinate descent and a proximal operator. It is less aggresive in 
    shrinking coefficients than the l_0 penalty , sparser and less biased than
    l_1 norm(lasso), which is extremely useful in high-dimensional case and
    when predictors are highly correlated. Our package also offers the  choice
    of lasso (q=1), it can be useful when the model is not extremely sparse.
